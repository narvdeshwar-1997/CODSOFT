            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and
                accumulated knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term
                socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the
                Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is
                designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and
                directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often
                little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead,
                the entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all
                adults act as teachers</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Technology plays another significant role in educational success.
                Educational technology is commonly associated with the use of modern digital devices, like computers.
                But understood in the broadest sense, it involves a wide range of resources and tools for learning,
                including basic aids that do not involve the use of machines, like regular books and worksheets.
                Educational technology can benefit learning in various ways. In the form of media, it often takes the
                role of the primary supplier of information in the classroom. This means that the teacher can focus
                their time and energy on other tasks, like planning the lesson and guiding students as well as assessing
                educational performance.

            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Organized institutions play a key role for various aspects of education. Institutions like schools, universities, teacher training institutions, and ministries of education make up the education sector. They interact both with each other and with other stakeholders, such as parents, local communities, and religious groups. Further stakeholders are NGOs, professionals in healthcare, law enforcement, media platforms, and political leaders. Many people are directly involved in the education sector. They include students, teachers, and school principals as well as school nurses and curriculum developers.
